This repository contains all code necessary for software to analyse the tyrosinase activity of colonies containing mutant tyrosianse enzymes produced by error prone PCR.
Two Python scripts are above:
Script 1 - Tyrosinase_variant_screening.py = The main program for analysis of tyrosinase activity in variant colonies. Includes a graphical user interface for ease of use.
Script 2 - The function used for analysis of values obtained from excel files containing both tyrosinase activity data (Δ400nm) and BCA data from 96-well plates.
Also included are two excel files - one for tyrosinase activity data (Δ400nm) and the other for BCA data from a 96-well plate containing tyrosinase variant colonies.
All code used is Python, a list of dependent repositories is below:
-  pandas
-  numpy
-  seaborn
-  matplotlib.pyplot
- matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg
- PySimpleGUI
- os

Two excel files containing results of a BCA assay and quinone formation for a set of colonies in a 96 well plate are in this repository.
To analyse these do the following: 
- Upload the file "230728_RM1_P1_activity.xlsx" using the "Activity File" button. This file contains tyrosinase activity data from 88 variant colonies, and four control colonies.
- Upload the file "230728_RM1_P1_BCA.xlsx" using the "BCA File" button. This file contains protein concentration data derived from a BCA assay of homogenates from the same 88 control colonies and four control colonies.
- Press Analyze and then press Plot.
